Simfile (.sm) charts used for games like [StepMania](https://www.stepmania.com/), [Etterna Online](https://etternaonline.com/), [Not In The Groove (NotITG)](https://www.noti.tg/), etc.

You can create and view these charts by using a program called [ArrowVortex](https://arrowvortex.ddrnl.com) that I use to chart if I'm not charting with Psych Engine.

These files can also be converted to the FNF `.json` format by using a Python script that converts them. (Just search up fnf-to-sm on Google, you should be able to find it easy.)

*The above mentioned method doesn't work for me, so I use Kade Engine's built-in SM parser to convert it myself*.

*Again*, as mentioned in the other `HOW TO USE` file in the `FNF JSON Format` folder, these charts have an unfinished or no opponent side.
